## 🔍 About Me

I am an Electrical and Electronics Engineering student with a strong interest in  
**embedded systems and low-level firmware development**.

I focus on building systems **close to hardware**, emphasizing:
- Register-level programming  
- Peripheral configuration  
- Interrupt-driven design  
- Clean and maintainable firmware architecture  

My learning approach is **project-driven**, translating theory into working embedded systems.

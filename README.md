## 🔍 About Me
I am an Electrical and Electronics Engineering student interested in
embedded systems and low-level firmware development.

I focus on learning through **hands-on embedded projects**, working
close to hardware using **bare-metal programming**

## 📂 Embedded Projects

Some of the projects:

### 🔹 ADC + DMA Sensor Sampler
Continuous analog data acquisition using timer-triggered ADC and DMA
(circular mode).  
🔗 Repo: Coming soon

---

### 🔹 UART Command Console
Interrupt-driven serial command interface to control hardware
(LED, PWM duty cycle, etc.).  
🔗 Repo: Coming soon

---

### 🔹 PWM-Controlled DC Motor Driver
Timer-based PWM generation for DC motor speed control using an external
motor driver.  
🔗 Repo: Coming soon

---

### 🔹 Bare-Metal I2C Driver
Custom I2C master driver to interface with temperature sensors
(TMP102 / LM75).  
🔗 Repo: Coming soon

---

### 🔹 Mini Task Scheduler
Lightweight cooperative task scheduler implemented using SysTick and
state machines.  
🔗 Repo: Coming soon
